**StringV** is a string library for C.

This is primarily a project to gain a deeper understanding of **C** fundamentals.

Another goal is to work on optimizing algorithms for performance for future projects.

Eventually I will be stripping this project down in order to build a lightweight library for embedded MCU architectures.

I will be looking to mostly target 8 bit architectures, but may look into potentially targeting 16 bit or 32 bit in the future.
